## What is a hostname?

From the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname) - In computer networking, a hostname (archaically nodename[1]) is a label that is assigned to a device connected to a computer network and that is used to identify the device in various forms of electronic communication such as the World Wide Web, e-mail or Usenet. Hostnames may be simple names consisting of a single word or phrase, or they may be structured.

In short, a hostname is a unique identifier(label) that is applied to a computer by the administrator of that computer.
