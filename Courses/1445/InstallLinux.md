## Decide which Linux distribution to use
* I suggest an apt based distribution for the reason that I am most familiar with the apt package manager. The following are some candidates.
  1. Linux Mint 17 - KDE, Cinnamon, Mate, xfce, any of these will be fine.
  1. Ubuntu
  1. Debian
* I reccommend avoiding the following:
  1. Zorin
  1. RedHat
  1. Arch
  1. Gentoo

Note that there is nothing wrong with any of these Linux distributions. I suggest avoiding them because I have little recent experience using them, and thus I am less likely to be able to help you quickly fix problems which may occur. If you know what you are doing, proceed at your own risk.
